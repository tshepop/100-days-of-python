This is the journey of working through python challenges. This repository will be used as a record of daily challenges completed, while going through The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023. With this repo I hope to show my understanding of the python language and how I use different ways arriving at solutions.

## What is the Purpose

To move from beginner to mastery of Python. It will take years to full mastery, this is the beginning. 

## Main Goal
To be a **backend developer**.
